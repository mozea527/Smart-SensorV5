Lettuce Growth Guide and Environmental Recommendations

Soil pH and Nutrition:
Lettuce grows best in soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8. This range helps nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus become available to plants. Add compost or manure to make the soil rich and loose. Use a 10-10-10 fertilizer when planting. You can also use chicken manure tea or vermicompost. If the soil is too acidic, add lime. Healthy soil helps lettuce grow fast and strong.

Soil Moisture and Irrigation:
Keep the soil moist at all times, not too wet and not too dry. Lettuce needs 1–2 inches of water weekly. Use mulch like straw to keep the soil moist. Drip irrigation works best. Avoid overwatering, which causes root rot. During dry days, water before the soil dries up.

Soil Temperature:
Ideal soil temperature is 15°C to 20°C. If it’s too hot, lettuce may grow flowers early (bolting), which makes leaves bitter. Use white mulch or plant in the morning or late afternoon to reduce heat. In places like San Andres, lettuce grows well from October to March. Shade nets can help during hot weather.

Air Humidity and Climate:
Lettuce likes moderate air moisture (50%–70%). High humidity can cause disease, while dry air dries the leaves. Space out the plants and water in the morning so leaves can dry by noon. Use raised beds and rotate crops each season for better plant health.

Light Intensity (Lux):
Lettuce needs 6–8 hours of sunlight daily (about 40,000–70,000 lux). Too much hot sun can damage leaves. Use shade nets or plant near taller crops. Cloudy mornings help reduce heat in places like Romblon. Light helps leaves grow full and green.

Soil Health and Organic Matter:
Use compost, vermicompost, or manure to make soil healthy. The soil should be loose and airy. Don’t plant lettuce in the same spot every time. Use beans or peanuts between lettuce crops to refresh the soil. Wash out salts from fertilizers if needed.

Recommended Lettuce Varieties:
For places like San Andres, grow 'Green Ice', 'Grand Rapids', and 'Red Rapid'. They grow fast and don’t mind the heat. 'Buttercrunch' is also good. You can harvest in 30–40 days. For cooler months, try 'Great Lakes'. Mix varieties to get better harvests and healthy crops all year.
